<h6>By Christellane Osena</h6>
<p>Hi! I'm Christellane (chris-tell-lane). I am a senior studying Computer
  Information Systems at Baruch College. I have taken classes in Web Design,
  Python, SQL, and C++. I have an associate's degree in graphic design from FIT.
  I hope to become a full-stack web developer one day. I am taking this
  micro-credential because I am interested in learning more about software
  engineering.</p>
