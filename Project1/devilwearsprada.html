<h2> OPINION: </h2></center>
<p> The Devil Wears Prada is a classic film for people who love fashion and dream of working in New York City. The film gives importance to why fashion matters. But it also includes the cons in working in the industry. In the film, the main character gets a job as an assistant to a powerful magazine editor and tries her best to survive her excessive demands. This is one of my favorite movies since the main character is my favorite actress, Anne Hathaway. Her and Meryl Streep's performance in this movie is outstanding. I also liked the fashion in this movie and how the main character learned how to dress and appreciate fashion. <br><br>
I used the color dark red for the background and heading text to match with the stiletto heel from the movie poster. The color red associates with longing, signifying the main character's wanting for her to be liked by her boss. The main character tried to do what she can to please her with her demands. This color is also related to love - another element in the movie through the romantic relationship of the main character. </p>
