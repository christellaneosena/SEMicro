<h1> SUMMARY: </h1>
<p> "Five years, eight months, 12 days and counting -- that's how long Debbie Ocean has been devising the biggest heist of her life. She knows what it's going to take -- a team of the best people in the field, starting with her partner-in-crime Lou Miller. Together, they recruit a crew of specialists, including jeweler Amita, street con Constance, suburban mom Tammy, hacker Nine Ball, and fashion designer Rose. Their target -- a necklace that's worth more than $150 million." </p>

<h2> OPINION: </h2></center>
<p> The movie Ocean's 8 is a sequel of the "Ocean's 11" series and features an all-female cast. The plot is based on the main character, Debbie Ocean's, plan to pull of the biggest jewel heist along with seven accomplices. In the movie, it shows how the eight accomplices plan to successfully execute the heist. I like how this movie has an all-female cast with famous actresses. Anne Hathaway is my favorite actress of all time. Her perfomance in this movie is amazing and so did the others. I also liked how this took place during the Met Gala, which is an event that I look forward to because of the fashion. The heist was clever and very well thought of and I liked the twist at the end. <br><br>
I used a red color for the background and heading text to match with the movie poster. The color red is associated with longing and anger. The heist pulled in the movie is something that the main character has been wanting to do since she was in prison for six years. She also did this heist as an act of revenge, showing her anger.
