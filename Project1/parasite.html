<h1> SUMMARY: </h1>
<p> "Meet the Park Family: the picture of aspirational wealth. And the Kim Family, rich in street smarts but not much else. Be it chance or fate, these two houses are brought together and the Kims sense a golden opportunity. Masterminded by college-aged Ki-woo, the Kim children expediently install themselves as tutor and art therapist, to the Parks. Soon, a symbiotic relationship forms between the two families. The Kims provide "indispensable" luxury services while the Parks obliviously bankroll their entire household. When a parasitic interloper threatens the Kims' newfound comfort, a savage, underhanded battle for dominance breaks out, threatening to destroy the fragile ecosystem between the Kims and the Parks." </p>

<h2> OPINION: </h2></center>
<p>The film Parasite shows the inequality between the rich and the poor in society. In the film, the Park family found an opportunity to live a better life by living off of the Kim family. Through lies and deception, the Parks were able to have their family of four to be the help of the Kims. This film is unlike any other films I have ever seen. It had a lot of plot twists that were very shocking and unexpected. The movie was in Korean and can only be watched by reading the captions. Despite having to do that, the overall mood throughout the film helped with the communication.
<br>
I used a dark green color scheme for the background and heading text to be cohesive with the poster. It also reflects on the scene where they were outside for the party, which shows a lot of the grass. The color green also associates with money, greed, and luxury - a key part for the plot of the movie. </p>
